A solution for displaying which elevaotrs are faster for you,
while waiting for the two malicious elevators of new engineering building.

How it works

uses 2 ARDUINO UNO boards, interconnected
2 PIR sensors
3 4-legged Ultrasonic distance sensors

FIrst arduino is used for taking in sensory inputs, and delivers it to second arduino.
Second arduino is used for displaying informations, relaying distance informations and lights LEDs and LCDS.
One segment of LED is set for 1 meter by default
EV1 round trip time: 1min
EV2 round trip time: 2min
